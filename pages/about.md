Out there in the world wide web there are so many pages and many about pages like that one here. They are describing the 
nitty-gritty of what to expect. But did you ever sat down, looking at the blinking cursor and questioning yourself what 
to write. Sometimes you know exactly what to write and get even into a rush not to forget what your head is just spinning, 
but sometimes... I am sure about you encountered that in quite a lot of contexts as well as I am encountering that in 
this very moment. 

A few first words I managed to write, so I'll take my chances.

That lab here you came by is about software development. The different technologies and common concepts which I 
encounter every day hanging around in the office and in my private time. Not only once I read about: when you want to 
understand a concept, a technology or an idea do not only try it but explain it to someone. 

That someone is at first I think me. With writing about the things I try out for myself I hope to gather a better 
understanding and perhaps get in touch with other developers out there. Developers which share the ideas, concepts and 
technique which I like most. Among a few of these are...

- Modern C++ Development
- Unbiased Javascript Development
- Clean Code and Refactoring
- Microservice Architectures and Structures
- Keeping flexible solutions simple

So whats to expect here, you'll find a loose coupled short and long articles written in a casual way about the 
things I think about, work with and try to learn.
